# coatlessali's Sonic The Fighters Tools
Welcome to my tools repo! These are just some little things I made to make my life easier. 

## fixheader.py
This tool fixes your DDS headers so that the game can read them correctly.

## farcpack
This is a bash wrapper for the MikuMikuLibrary utility FarcPack. It requires mono to be installed, and for the real farcpack tool to be downloaded and extracted somewhere. At some point, I plan to make HoneyPatcher handle this. **You must edit the script and change the FARCPACK variable to reflect the location of your farcpack.exe.**
