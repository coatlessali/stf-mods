# coatlessali's Sonic The Fighters Releases
Welcome to my mods repo! Most of these can be applied as BPS patches to existing game files. These all assume you have extracted `rom.psarc` previously, either manually or by installing Sonic the Fighters: Community Edition.

## fixheader.py
This tool fixes your DDS headers so that the game can read them correctly.

## Sonic The Fighers: Dark Theme
This mod replaces all of the UI with glassy black variants where applicable.
