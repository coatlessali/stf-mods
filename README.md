# coatlessali's Sonic The Fighters Releases
Welcome to my mods & tools repo! Most of the mods can be applied as BPS patches to existing game files. These all assume you have extracted `rom.psarc` previously, either manually or by installing Sonic the Fighters: Community Edition.

## fixheader.py
This tool fixes your DDS headers so that the game can read them correctly.

## farcpack
This is a bash wrapper for the MikuMikuLibrary utility FarcPack. It requires mono to be installed, and for the real farcpack tool to be downloaded and extracted somewhere. **You must edit the script and change the FARCPACK variable to reflect the location of your farcpack.exe.**

## Sonic The Fighers: Dark Theme
This mod replaces all of the UI with glassy black variants where applicable.
